# Vite React SSR Book List App with Redux Toolkit

A full-stack web application built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and server-side rendering (SSR) for a seamless user experience. This project utilizes Redux Toolkit along with Thunk middleware for state management, making API calls to fetch and display a list of books.

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Ensure fast initial loading and improved SEO by rendering React components on the server.
- **Redux Toolkit with Thunk**: Manage complex application state with ease using Redux Toolkit, and handle asynchronous actions with Redux Thunk middleware.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed language for enhanced developer experience and fewer runtime errors.
- **API Integration**: Fetch book data from an external API and display it in the application.

## Technologies Used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A blazing-fast frontend build tool that preconfigures development environment for React applications.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/): The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
- [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk): A Redux middleware for handling asynchronous actions.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used for SSR.
